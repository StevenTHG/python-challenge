# Python Challenge
Included in this repo are two Python challenges, both of which involve reading and writing CSV files. Each challenge folder contains subsequent folders labelled "Resources" and "analysis" which contain the CSV file to read and the text file that is outputted by the analysis. 

In the first challenege folder, the task was to read in a mock bank dataset to calculate values such as total number of months included, net total amount of profit/losses, average change in profit/losses, greatest increase in profits, and greatest decrease in profits.

In the second challenge folder, the task was to read in a mock election dataset to calculate the total number of votes, the list of candidates, their votes, their vote percentage, and who the winner of the election was.
